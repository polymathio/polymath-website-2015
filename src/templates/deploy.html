      <p>American Enterprise Institute came to us with a vision, and we immediately saw the potential for executing across so many platforms.</p>

    <p class="t-more-muted">This is the agony and the ecstasy of the creative process. Craft your narrative, hone your messaging, launch from a strong platform—and you will succeed. Fail to find thoughtful ways to communicate—and your ideas get lost in the crowd.</p>
    
    <p class="t-more-muted">There’s an old saying: <em>If a tree falls in the woods, and no one’s around to hear it, does it make a sound?</em> The same could be said of many a creative campaign… If your website goes live and no one visits, did it ever really launch? What if your video is published, but no one watches? If your next big initiative kicks off, and no one acts upon it, did it ever really happen?</p>

    <p class="t-more-muted">We believe great storytelling requires great telling, not simply great story. That’s why we work with clients to think through how to strategically bookend their communications efforts—Why plus How. How do we get people to care? How do we make your audience aware? How do we position your content for maximum effect?</p>

    <p class="t-more-muted">It’s that comprehensive approach that distinguishes Polymath in the creative agency space. We are your one-stop shop for strategy and storytelling. We work every day to dream plans, design platforms, and deploy projects like yours to infinity, beyond, and everywhere in between. That’s our mission, and we choose to accept it.</p>

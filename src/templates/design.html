      <p class="t-more-muted">We’ve been on your side of the table before: Polymath was birthed from the team that created the world’s largest religion and spirituality website. Now, we’ve assembled a group of experts who hail from snowy Canada to sunny Houston, DC, Atlanta, and beyond. Our flexibility as a remote-working agency allows us to tap the best talent, no matter where they live, and put them to work for your cause. When you work with Polymath, our team of storytellers join your brand on a journey from abstract concept to concrete deliverable—and have fun doing it.</p>

      <p class="t-more-muted">This is personal for us. We create, build, and design not just because it’s how we make a living. Truly, we couldn’t live any other way.</p>
